   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to preface's documentation!
===================================

**preface** is a set of basic utility functions that I'd like to be global in Python, and some utility types.
Stuff like getting any element from a set, flattening a list, etc.

These functions should be appropriately named but also not conflict with other names in the global space.

There is also a SumType that's useful for defining Python enums is an easier manner.

The name is a joke based on Haskell's prelude.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.

.. note:

   This project is under active development.
