Usage
=====

Installation
------------

To use preface, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install preface

Using SumTypes
--------------

Enumerations in Python don't have great support for exhaustiveness when type-checking with `mypy <https://github.com/python/mypy>`_. ``preface.SumType`` makes this easier.
