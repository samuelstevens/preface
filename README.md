# Python Preface

There are some basic utility functions that I'd like to be global in Python, and some utility types.
Stuff like getting any element from a set, flattening a list, etc.

These functions should be appropriately named but also not conflict with other names in the global space.

The name is a joke based on Haskell's prelude.
